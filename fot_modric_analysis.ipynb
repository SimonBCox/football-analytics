    "1) Think of a player who you enjoyed watching at the recent Men's or Women's World Cups.<br>\n",
    "2) What actions did they perform that were important and why?<br>\n",
    "3) Plot the actions and describe how the data supports or contradicts your own analysis.<br>\n",

    "During the FIFA World Cup 2018, Croatia captain Luca Modrić was awarded the best player of the tournament. In the Netherlands he is known as \"de kleine dribbelaar\" (the little dribbler). Let's find out how good of a dribbler he actually is. Therefore, we will be looking at the number of dribbles (or carries) performed by Modrić and initially compare that to his team mates' performance."
